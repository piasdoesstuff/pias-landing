# PIAS Landing Page — V1 Copy

## 1) Hero
**PIAS**
Personal Intelligence Augmentation System

A mindful human + AI workflow for designing, building, and shipping real outcomes.

Primary CTA: **See what we built together**
Secondary CTA: **Start your own workflow**

## 2) What PIAS does
### Strategy
Turn vague ideas into clear plans, priorities, and decisions.

### Execution
Move from plan to output: writing, research, coding, and operations.

### Automation
Set up repeatable systems so progress continues in the background.

### Iteration
Review results, capture learnings, and improve continuously.

### Security-minded
Operate with boundaries, least privilege, and practical safeguards.

## 3) How human + PIAS collaboration works
1. You define direction and intent.
2. PIAS structures the problem and proposes paths.
3. We execute in focused steps.
4. We review outcomes and lock improvements.

**Result:** Less chaos, faster execution, better decisions.

## 4) Proof-of-capability (this project)
In one collaboration flow, we:
- Designed product vision
- Structured project docs and operating protocols
- Set up voice, tools, and integrations
- Built a reproducible execution process
- Prepared this landing page workflow end-to-end

This page itself is part of the proof.

## 5) Mindful AI principles
- AI should **augment**, not replace, human judgment.
- Better systems beat random prompts.
- Security and privacy are design decisions, not afterthoughts.
- Small daily improvements compound into major leverage.
